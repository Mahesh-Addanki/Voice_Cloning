# Voice_Cloning_Project
Created a voice cloning model, that can generate a synthetic voice that sounds like a specific person.

This code file must be run directly in Jupyter Notebook with the audio files attached to the GitHub repository, with no need to download other files or anything else. Once you run this code automatically output will be generated and then you can hear the output automatically.
